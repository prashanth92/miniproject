miniproject
===========
This was an academic mini-project done in very limited time and it is not documented.
It basically gives you the average waiting time given a set of processes and their burst time.
You can select the scheduling algorithm that the processes are using.
I've been able to calculate the average waiting time using the following schuling algorithms
1) First Come First Serve(FCFS.txt)
2) Shortest Job First Scheduling(SJFS.txt)
3) Priority Scheduling(priority.txt)
4) Round-Robin Scheduling(rr.txt)

The set of processes have to be added individually to each file.
The program takes the data in this file to calculate the average waiting time.

to compile : gcc -Wall avgtime.c (run it like a normal C file)

./a.out
